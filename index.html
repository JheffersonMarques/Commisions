                    5+ years of pratical Java knowledge, i try to do each new thing as best as i can and keep constantly

                <p>
                    I was asked if i'd do commissions, but i didn't knew if i could or should, but recently i started
                    pondering about it doing it,
                    and then i decided to start taking commisions!

            <ul class="tos">
                <li><b>Delivery and Pricing : </b>Pricing and estimated time until devilery can change depening on mod
                    complexity;</li>
                <li><b>Payment : </b>A commission will be worked upon after a payment of at least 50% the agreed upon
                    price, with the other 50% being due within a week of the final delivery;</li>
                <li><b>Progress : </b>Progress will be shared with the commissioner, so it could be iterated upon, and until marked as
                    done, any feature can be changed;</li>
                <li><b>Changes on approved features : </b>Features marked as done, will be charged separetely to be changed;</li>
                <li><b>Additional Features : </b>Any additional features not outlined in the initial agreement will be charged separetely, with cost
                    being defined in the same rate as before;</li>
                <li><b>Usage : </b>Mods can be used in anyway (be it personal or comercial use) with credit attributed;</li>
                <li><b>Publishing : </b>Mods commisioned can be uploaded to mod agregation sites like CurseForge and Modrinth with a revenue
                    split of 25% to 75% (25% for me, 75% for the commissioner) after 3 months at minimum unless
                    otherwise specified.</li>
                <li><b>Refunds : </b>Refunds can be made in any step of the process, meaning the commission work will not be delivered,
                    and the non worked hours will be refunded (for example. a 40 hours project that has been worked on
                    for 8 hours, will recieve the remaining 32 hours as a refund), once the commissioner approved a
                    delivery, they can no longer ask for refunds;</li>
                <li><b>Source Code : </b>Any mods made via commissions will be made open source after 3-6 months under the MIT
                    License;</li>
